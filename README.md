This stopwatch app only shows minutes and seconds with three button, which are start, stop, and reset.

Start button, just like its name, will start time counting.

Stop button will stop the time counting. But, if you press the start button again, it will resume the stopwatch. So, you may be wondering this button's function is to pause the stopwatch, not stop it.

Reset button is used to reset the time. When the stopwatch is running, reset button will make the time to 00:00 and immediately start again. It doesn't stop it. But if you press this button when you stop the stopwatch, the time will become 00:00 and stay just like that.
